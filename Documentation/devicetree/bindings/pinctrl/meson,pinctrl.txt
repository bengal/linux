* Amlogic Meson pinmux controller

Pins are organized in banks; all banks except AO are controlled by the
same set of registers, while the AO bank uses a dedicated register
range. The device tree uses sub-nodes to represent set of banks which
share the same address space.

Required properties for the root node:
 - compatible: "amlogic,meson8-pinctrl"
 - reg: address and size of the common registers controlling gpio irq
   functionality

Required properties for gpio sub-nodes:
 - reg: should contain address and size for mux, pull-enable, pull and
   gpio register sets
 - reg-names: an array of strings describing the "reg" entries. Must
   contain "mux", "pull" and "gpio". "pull-enable" is optional and
   when it is missing the "pull" registers are used instead
 - gpio-controller: identifies the node as a gpio controller
 - #gpio-cells: must be 2

Valid gpio sub-nodes name are:
 - "banks" for the standard banks
 - "ao-bank" for the AO bank which belong to the special always-on
   power domain

Required properties for configuration nodes:
 - pins: the name of a pin group. The list of all available groups can
   be found in driver sources.
 - function: the name of a function to activate for the specified set
   of groups. The list of all available functions can be found in
   driver sources.

Example:

	pinctrl: pinctrl@c1109880 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8-pinctrl";
		reg = <0xc1109880 0x10>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		gpio: banks@c11080b0 {
			reg = <0xc11080b0 0x28>,
			      <0xc11080e4 0x18>,
			      <0xc1108120 0x18>,
			      <0xc1108030 0x30>;
			reg-names = "mux", "pull-enable", "pull", "gpio";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
               };

		gpio_ao: ao-bank@c1108030 {
			reg = <0xc8100014 0x4>,
			      <0xc810002c 0x4>,
			      <0xc8100024 0x8>;
			reg-names = "mux", "pull", "gpio";
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
		};
